KerasTuner: comes with Bayesian Optimization, Hyperband, and Random Search algorithms built-in, and is also designed to be easy for researchers to extend in order to experiment with new search algorithms.

KerasNLP: is a natural language processing library that supports users through their entire development cycle. Our workflows are built from modular components that have state-of-the-art preset weights and architectures when used out-of-the-box and are easily customizable when more control is needed.

KerasCV: is a repository of modular building blocks (layers, metrics, losses, data-augmentation) that applied computer vision engineers can leverage to quickly assemble production-grade, state-of-the-art training and inference pipelines for common use cases such as image classification, object detection, image segmentation, image data augmentation, etc.

AutoKeras is an AutoML system based on Keras. It is developed by DATA Lab at Texas A&M University. The goal of AutoKeras is to make machine learning accessible for everyone. It provides high-level end-to-end APIs such as ImageClassifier or TextClassifier to solve machine learning problems in a few lines, as well as flexible building blocks to perform architecture search.
